Code explanation
Creates a sudoers file (likely /etc/sudoers.d/50sysadmin).
Grants the sysadmin group full sudo privileges:
commands ['ALL'] → members of sysadmin can run any command.
runas 'ALL' → they can run commands as any user, including root.
Effectively, anyone in the sysadmin group has passwordless full root access.

Code summary

Skips execution on Windows.
On Linux/Unix, creates a sudoers rule that allows the sysadmin group to run all commands as any user via sudo.
So this role is a privilege escalation setup for sysadmin group members.

Inspec Test case 

Checks the sudoers file exists at /etc/sudoers.d/50sysadmin with correct owner, group, and permissions (0440).
Validates sudoers syntax using visudo -cf (important for preventing broken sudo configs).
Confirms the sysadmin group has ALL sudo privileges (ALL=(ALL) ALL)
Ensures the sysadmin group exists on the RedHat machine.
